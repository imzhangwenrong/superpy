= Introduction =

PyFog is a simple superpy application to create a cloud (or in this case a fog) of words based on some set of input documents. You can provide lists of web pages, files, or RSS feeds and PyFog will crawl them in parallel, count how often each word or group of words occurs, and display statistics on the most common words. 

To use Pyfog, you can just launch the fogGUI.py script from the command line or double click on it. On LINUX, this script should be located in your path (on my system it ends up in /usr/bin/fogGUI.py after you install superpy). On Windows, this usually goes in your scripts directory (e.g., in C:\Python25\Scripts\fogGUI.py). Once you start the fogGUI.py script, you should see a window showing the PyFog parameters:

If you quick on a question mark next to one of the parameters, a window will appear with information about that parameter. Once you have filled in the parameters as you like (or you can just leave the defaults), click OK to run PyFog. If you have started some superpy servers on your local machine and specified these in the serverList, PyFog will then send jobs to the remote machines. Otherwise, it will start a number of local servers to take advantage of the multiple processors on your machine. In any case, it will analyze the given sources and then show the frequency with which they occur as shown below.
