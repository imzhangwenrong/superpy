# Introduction #

This page describes various demonstration applications. These demonstrations are intended both to illustrate some of the things one can do with python cloud-computing capabilities as well as provide programmers example code so they can implement their own applications.

# PyFog #

PyFog is a simple superpy application to create a cloud (or in this case a fog) of words based on some set of input documents. You can provide lists of web pages, files, or RSS feeds and PyFog will crawl them in parallel, count how often each word or group of words occurs, and display statistics on the most common words. For more information see the PyFog wiki.
